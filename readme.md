# Tommy Lake (WIP)

A new library for the Vulkan API, named after the character of GTA Vice City - Tommy Vercetti.

## Planned Features

- Based on C++20 and Vulkan-Hpp 
- Compatible with C language (2017 and beyond)
- Extensible and modular, and cheatful
- Much simpler than regular Vulkan API
- Made without VKt/VKh (outdated)
- Compatible with OpenGL 4.5 or beyond

### Compute

The main focus will be on general calculations (i.e. compute). It will be like vuda, or opencl.

### Ray Tracing

Ray tracing will NOT be central to this library. But she will probably appear...

### Rasterization

Rasterization will also NOT be the centerpiece of this library. 

### OpenGL

A separate focus will be given to compatibility with regular OpenGL.
